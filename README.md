# FooDB v1.0.0:
FooDB is an small, open-source, extendable and fully customizable JSON database written in Python using the built-in json and os  modules.

# About
At first, FooDB stores the data stored in it in RAM, but once the data is stored, it takes the in-memory database(which is actually just a JSON object) and saves it in a database file.

# Customization
FooDB can easily be extended and customized by opening the custom.py file.
Just make your own methods and objects in the custom class or create new classes and customize the database any way you want!
If you liked FooDB, fork our GitHub repository and give us a star!
Also, JavaScript and TypeScript versions of FooDB are about to arrive very soon!
