# FooDB v1.0.0:
FooDB is an small, open-source, extendable and fully customizable JSON database written in Python using the built-in json and os  modules.

# About
FooDB stores the data stored in it in RAM and is an in-memory data structure, so it's very fast and performant and suitable for speed-critical applications.
This means that it is optimized for usage as a cache like Redis, but can also be used as a primary database.
Using it as the primary database for an application that needs to store large amounts of data is not always optimal, as that would 
lead to high memory usage which may slow down a user's device.

# Customization
FooDB can easily be extended and customized by opening the custom.py file.
Just make your own methods and objects in the custom class or create new classes and customize the database any way you want!
